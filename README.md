# Home Assistant Configuration

This is my configuration for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)!

This repository is populated with the help of the [git pull](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/tree/master/git_pull) addon.  Should you want to run my Home Assistant in your environment, you can by installing the add on and then using this repository as your source.

Of course, if you don't have the exact same hardware, this repo won't do much for you.  In which case, feel free to browse the files and see how the automations are set up.

If you want to set up git pull on your side as well, feel free to look at the `.gitignore` to see what files aren't needed or preferred to be committed.  You can also look at my `settings.json` within my `.vscode/` directory to see how I have VS Code working.
